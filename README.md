# MPD Client

## Setup
You will need an MPD server to which the service can connect.
Either install MPD directly on your machine or use a docker
image like https://hub.docker.com/r/randomcoww/mpd/

MPD initially does not have any playlists.
Install the cli client for MPD "mpc" and use it to add songs
to your collection and create a playlist with songs.
